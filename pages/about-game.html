                  <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by CD
                        Projekt 1. It is the third game in The Witcher video game series, played in an open world with a
                        third-person perspective 1. The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic
                        mythology 1. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher, and
                        search for his adopted daughter, who is on the run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt 1. Players
                        battle the game’s many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and
                        complete quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt’s
                        abilities and purchase equipment 1. The game’s story has three possible endings, determined by
                        the player’s choices at key points in the narrative 1.</p>
